# Project Overview

This is a repo made from following Stephen Ulibarri (the goat)'s Unreal Engine C++ course.

Where my project differs from what you would get from just following along, is mostly its focus on modularity, decoupling and low level performance.
My game code is divided into modules for easy integrating into my upcoming project. It is also great for keeping my code organized, and least of all, my compile times low.
